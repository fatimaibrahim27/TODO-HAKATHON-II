Todo Full-Stack Web Application - Phase II

Target audience: Developers and hackathon judges evaluating the full-stack implementation

Focus:
- Transform the CLI Todo app into a modern, multi-user web application
- Implement task CRUD operations with user-specific filtering
- Integrate secure authentication with Better Auth and JWT tokens
- Connect frontend (Next.js App Router) to backend (FastAPI) and Neon PostgreSQL
- Ensure responsive UI and proper API design per Spec-Kit guidelines

Success criteria:
- All CRUD endpoints working correctly with authentication
- JWT authentication properly enforced, unauthorized access returns 401
- Frontend fully responsive with Next.js App Router and Tailwind CSS
- Database schema implemented in Neon PostgreSQL, tasks linked to users
- Spec-driven workflow followed using Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus
- All tasks persist correctly across sessions

Constraints:
- Technology stack must be: Next.js 16+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon PostgreSQL, Better Auth
- Must use Spec-Kit workflow
